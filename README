PZ Bookmarker
=============

Overview
--------
So, have a smartphone or other input challenged device?  It's a PITA typing 
those long URL's with the crappy keyboard on them isn't it?  Wouldn't it be 
nice if there was a free website you could go to, type in a short, 
easy-to-remember pneumonic of your choosing, and then be taken to the site?  

I thought so, hence this project.  PZ Bookmarker allows you to host an app on 
the Google App Engine (http://code.google.com/appengine/) that presents a web 
interface that allows you to encode url's using whatever pneumonic you wish.

But Really
----------
The scope of the project is essentially personal in nature -- I wanted to have 
some project on GitHub, I wanted to play around with some web technologies, 
I wanted to have the chance to explore other cool things, and specifically I 
wanted further practice working with Google App Engine.  Hence this project.

TLDR: I wanted a "playground" to try out new and interesting technologies, and
this just happens to be it. :)

Some things I want to play with/add/try out:

- implement a 1st version. ;D
- adding RESTful interface (lookup a bookmark, add a new pneumonic, etc)
- OAuth authentication (make the GAE app a resource owner that clients have to authenticate against)
